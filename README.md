# footrulr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of footrulr is to provide some functionality to compute
sentence comparisons using metrics frequently employed in Machine
Translation and Text Summarization evaluation.

The name is inspired from Rstudioâ€™s [yardstick
package](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/) for Machine Learning
evaluation metrics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of footrulr from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kanishkamisra/footrulr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(footrulr)

bleu("the cat the cat on the mat", c("the cat is on the mat", "there is a cat on the mat"), n = 3)
#> [1] 0.4
bleu("the cat is on a mat", c("the cat is on the mat", "there is a cat on the mat"), n = 3)
#> [1] 0.5
```
