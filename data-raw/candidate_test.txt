A bad attitude toward a good faceThe volume of the shrunken body is doubledI do not think I'll go straight without a hint.Black If You're Pink We're Pretty Savage (Blackpink)"When you want it,"You can do anything with a knifeFat check with both handsFact checkA snowy topFish that meet waterI read a little ToxicYou're Hurricane I'm foxyThink twice.I can not pretend to be nice like everyone else.Do not mistake it.It's for me to smile easily.I do not know yet.You are as flaming as you can be.If you wanted something goodOh wait til 'I do what I doHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du duAye myeHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du duAye myeNow I'm walkingBlackpink four way intersectionRun it everywhereYou bucket list buds I bought itIt is also bad girl to push and pull you awayWhen the bass drops it's another banger
