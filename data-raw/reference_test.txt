"I may look sweet, but I don't act like it"My slender figure hides twice the volumeI give it to them straight Don't care what people thinkBlack to the Pink We're pretty and savageI take whenever I wantWhatever you do doesn't faze meMy hands are full of fat checks"If you're curious, go ahead and fact-check"My standards are up topI'm in my element"A little dangerous, I'm Toxic""You fall for me, I'm Foxy"Think twiceI don't pretend to play nice like othersDon't flatter yourselfI smile easily because it does me goodYou don't know yet"But if you want, go ahead and test me"You're too predictable.  If you wanted something easyOh wait til' I do what I doHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du"Ah yeah, ah yeah"Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du"Ah yeah, ah yeah"The street I'm walkingBLACKPINK 4-way intersection"North, South, East and West, in all directions, we run it"I bought your entire bucket list"I pull you in, then push you away, I do as I please because I'm a bad girl""Love it or hate it, whatever they say, when the bass drop it's another banger"
